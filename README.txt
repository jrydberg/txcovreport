===========

This is a simple reporter plugin for Twisted's trial unittest tool.
Provided that you have "test-case-name" meta-variables in your files,
like Twisted do, you can get per-file coverage reports.

Tested with twisted 10.0

You need 'figleaf' for this to work.  Just install it with easy_install.
